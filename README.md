Lead Tracking

A project done on Python-Django-HTML which is basically used to tracks generated by the product owners.
The owner (admin basically) will create accounts for multiple companies/persons which will have access to the leads as shared by the adamin.
With Python-Django-HTML we have sqlite3 as the backend, bootstrap for griding/styling.
